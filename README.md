by Youhan Guan, Lalaine Ulit-Destajo, Mengmei (Rose) Zhou

###Description:
Encounter explores the experience of co-existence with synthetic creatures through mixed reality approaches. The installation consists of an immersive projection space and a tangible play area. In the projection space, participants become virtual creatures that explores the ecosystem on a local scale. At the tangible station, participants impersonate planners of the habitat to shape the environment globally. 

The autonomous creatures are responsive to their surroundings, however they may not choose to embrace all the changes that the planners introduce.

Software: Unity 3D, C#
Hardware: Xbox Kinect V2, 2 projectors, web cam, 2 computers, 1 tripleHead2go

   Participants shape and form the virtual environment the creatures inhabit by moving physical objects that represent various structures in the environment. 
    - fiducial Recognition
